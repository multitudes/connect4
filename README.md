# connect4

Here at 42 we do a weekend rush project. This weekend it is about Connect4.

> The goal of this rush is to write a Connect Four. That’s not all, you will need to write
an AI to play against you. Wonderful, isn’t it?


## General rules
• The assignment has to be written in C.
• No norm.
• cc is used as compiler.
• You have to compile with the following flags -Wall -Wextra -Werror.
• You have to turn in a Makefile which will compile your source files.
• Your program should not quite unexpectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double
free, and so forth) except for undefined behaviors.
• Within the mandatory part, you’re allowed to use the following:
◦ Our Libft library. And the following C functions:  malloc(3), free(3), rand(3), srand(3), time(3)

## Mandatory part
It is played in the terminal.

## Bonus part
We can choose any lib you want (like sdl or ncurses).
